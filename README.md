## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Document Processing
- **Smart Excel Parsing**: Automatically extracts tables from complex Excel files with mixed content
- **Flexible PDF Matching**: Intelligently matches PDFs using Cablex P/N and FAIR Identifier patterns
- **Advanced OCR**: Processes scanned PDFs using Tesseract OCR to make them searchable
- **Visual Highlighting**: Creates highlighted PDFs with yellow markers on found part numbers
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses multithreading to process multiple PDFs simultaneously (up to 8 threads)
- **Batch Processing**: Handles entire directory structures with hundreds of files efficiently

### User Interface
- **Interactive GUI**: Modern interface with real-time progress tracking
- **Clickable Results Table**: Double-click to open Excel files, PDFs, or highlighted outputs
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter results by "All", "PDF Found", "PDF Not Found", "Part Number Not Found", or "Part Number Found"
- **File-Based Progress**: Progress bar shows Excel file processing with real-time updates
- **Process Controls**: Stop current processing or Reset for a new run
- **Built-in Help**: Comprehensive help dialog accessible with one click

### Output Options
- **Centralized Results**: Option to save all highlighted PDFs in a single output folder
- **CSV Export**: Comprehensive results export with all matching details
- **Searchable PDFs**: OCR-processed PDFs become fully searchable with selectable text

### Advanced Features
- **Recursive Search**: Finds FAI and CoC folders in subdirectories (up to depth 3)
- **Force OCR**: Option to force OCR on all PDFs regardless of text content
- **Auto-sizing Window**: GUI automatically adjusts to fit content

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.11 or later** - [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Tesseract OCR** - [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
3. **Poppler utilities** - Included in repository as `poppler.zip`

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Double-click `run.bat`**

That's it! The script will:
- âœ… Verify Python is installed
- âœ… Check for Tesseract OCR
- âœ… Install Python dependencies automatically
- âœ… Extract and configure Poppler utilities
- âœ… Launch the GUI application

**Note:** See [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed setup guide and troubleshooting.

## ðŸ”§ Manual Installation

### 1. Install Python 3.11+
Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### 2. Install Tesseract OCR
Download and install from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- Install to default location: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python pdf_excel_processor.py
```

The application will automatically:
- Detect Tesseract installation
- Extract Poppler from included `poppler.zip`
- Configure all paths for the session

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Launching the Application

**Option 1: Using run.bat (Recommended)**
```bash
run.bat
```

**Option 2: Direct Python execution**
```bash
python pdf_excel_processor.py
```

### Using the GUI

1. **Select your directory** containing FAI and Material CoC folders

2. **Configure options**:
   - âœ… **Force OCR**: Process all PDFs with OCR (recommended for scanned documents)
   - Choose output mode:
     - **Separate folder** (safe): Saves highlighted PDFs in `highlighted_pdfs/` folder

3. **Click "Process Files"** to start
   - Monitor progress bar with real-time updates
   - View detailed progress in the log area
   - Multiple PDFs are processed in parallel for faster performance
   - Click **Stop** to halt processing at any time

4. **Review results** in the interactive table:
   - **Double-click** Excel files to open them
   - **Double-click** PDF files to view originals
   - **Double-click** "Yes" in Highlighted column to view highlighted PDFs
   - Use **Filter** dropdown to focus on specific results

5. **Click "Reset"** to clear and start a new run

6. **Click "Help"** for comprehensive usage instructions

## Error Handling

The application handles:
- Missing Excel columns
- Corrupted PDF files
- Invalid directory structures
- Permission errors
- Memory management for large files

## Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Processing**: The application automatically uses up to 8 threads for PDF processing
2. **Memory usage**: Process directories in batches if handling thousands of files
3. **PDF processing**: Highlighted PDFs are saved separately to preserve originals
4. **PATH Configuration**: `run.bat` automatically configures all paths, even if system PATH is reset

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Python not found:**
- Install Python 3.11+ from python.org
- Make sure "Add Python to PATH" was checked during installation
- Restart your computer after installation

**Tesseract not found:**
- Install Tesseract from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Install to default location: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`
- Restart your computer after installation

**Poppler not found:**
- Ensure `poppler.zip` is in the same folder as `run.bat`
- Delete the `poppler` folder and run `run.bat` again to re-extract

**PATH issues:**
- `run.bat` automatically configures PATH for each session
- No permanent system changes are needed
- If issues persist, try running as Administrator

**Excel file not reading:**
- Ensure Excel file is not corrupted
- Check that required columns exist
- Try opening and re-saving the Excel file

**PDF highlighting not working:**
- Verify PDF is not encrypted
- Check PDF is not a scanned image
- Ensure Part Number text is searchable in PDF
